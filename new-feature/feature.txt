Merging branches simply means you combine the two commits of these branches. Well, to have a merged branch with all the code implemented or incorporated in this branch. Merging always works from a "I am currently in a branch that should receive additional commits", way of thinking. So in our case, this means that if we want to add the feature that we just edit in the feature branch to our master branch, we have to switch to the master branch first and then merge the feature branch into the master branch.
